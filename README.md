# Stock Analysis

## Overview of project  

Steve has done his majors in finance, and he is newly recruited in stock brokerage. His parents  
wish to invest through him in green stocks. Steve's parents are ready to invest in DAQO New Energy Corporation.
however, they don’t have prior knowledge about this stock. Steve is cautious and wants to analyze “Daqo” stocks for his 
parents along with other energy stocks in order to diversify their portfolio.


## Purpose

Clearly Green Stocks analyzation is required. We have large data for 12 Green stocks companies. Data for 2017-18 will be analyzed and compared for decision making. All will be done in excel VBA, in a more organized way. In VBA codes can be written to compile data, perform operations, calculations and modify it as needed.   
VBA is a powerful program to handle large dataset. 


## Results

# DQ ANALYSIS

Since "DQ" was the first preference for investment. We will see how it did in 2018 

In year 2018 "DQ" performed poorly and dropped to -63% clearly its not a good option to invest.

# Green Stocks Analysis 2017
In year 2017 all Green energy stocked performed well except for "TERP"
which dropped to -7.2%. Particularly "DQ" topped among all by the increment
of approximately 200%

# Green Stocks Analysis 2018
Green stocks performed bad in year 2018. we only have two performing stocks "ENPH" and "RUN"
"RUN" jumped from 5.5% in 2017 to 84% in 2018. 
"ENPH" dropped from 129.5% in 2017 to 81.9% in 2018.
RUN can be considered for investment as gains are 78.5% in a year.

## Summary

## Review on refactoring code in general:

According to different performance parameters, both original and refactor code are highly performed scripts with their own pros and cons. Let’s figure out some of the important performance parameters.

## Running Time:
If we analyze the running time of original and refactored code for all stocks analysis. We can conclude that the refactor code amazingly works quite well and proved to be more time efficient. The refactored code for all stocks analysis works in approx. 28% less than original code which makes it highly time efficient.

## Memory Usage:

As a comparison of memory storage of refactored and original code, I have observed that we just used variables for determination of total volume, starting price, and ending price. On the other hand, I have used arrays for these parameters in the case of refactored code. So, I can conclude that refactored code is more organized in terms of memory and provides a backup for the parameters of all companies.

## Complexity:

In terms of complexity, we have many simple techniques and algorithms for original code. In the case of refactored script, the methods and algorithms are more complex which make it difficult for everyone to understand sometimes. But at some points, the original code also shows complex behavior as we have the concept of nested loops in original code as comparison to simple loops in refactored code.

## Design Analysis:

If we look at design analysis of both codes, refactored code is more formatted which makes it more informative and easier to understand then original code. At the same time, the original code has a button to run the analysis which makes it more user friendly as compared to the refactored code.
